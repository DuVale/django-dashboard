# Django Dashboard #

This project allow you to create a dashboard with moveable gadgets in Django.

This project is based on http://james.padolsey.com/tag/nettuts/

I have enhanced the dashboard to allow you to create extra fields/options in the gadgets.

You can create as many dashboards as you like they are per auth\_user

Each gadget has it own python file and URL.

download the project and do a syncdb then runserver and goto
http://127.0.0.1:8000/dashboard/test/ (test is the name of the dashboard try changing it)
then click add gadget.

Good luck and happy coding
